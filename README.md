# Dotfiles
Here are some of my settings and configurations files on my environment. I'll keep them here mostly to see the changes I make
through time (go back to an old version if necessary) and I'll use git if have want to use my settings on another machine. 

##Quick start
This will get you started:
```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/luiseduardo1/.dotfiles.git
$ script/bootstrap
```
The script will link all your .symlink extension files to your home directory.
